# Bingo board generator

A generator that takes a csv makes randomized bingo boards out of it.
This was made based on an icebreaker game using bingo boards: you had
to talk to people to check off the various squares.  This automates
producing the boards with squares interesting to your group of people.

Features:
* Input csv file with five columns (ignores first header).
* Each column gets randomized into the respective bingo board column.
* Can generate any number of boards into a single PDF file.


## Usage

$ python3 bingo.py input.csv --n=5 [output.csv]
